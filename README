= Challis: a soft lightweight cloth (usually printed)

Challis is a lightweight markup language along the lines of Markdown
and Textile.  It focuses on a simple implementation while still being
friendly to authors.


== Usage

Challis uses the default `to_html` calling convention:

---
Challis.new(source).to_html
---

== Tutorial

Paragraphs are seperated by empty lines.

Unordered lists are marked by `*`, ordered lists with `#`, and they
can nest:

* unordered list

  # one
  # two
  # three

* another item of the unordered list.

  this paragraph belongs to the same item.

Only paragraph indentation matters, so you could have typed as well:

* another item of the unordered list.

  this paragraph
belongs to
the same item.

Definition lists are marked by `::`:

foo:: bar

quux:: meh

Verbatim code is written between lines of `---`, raw HTML can be
inserted between `---html` and `---`.

---
class Challis
  ...
end
---

" Block quotes are introduced by a double-quote and whitespace.

  Of course, they nest as well.

Headers are marked up with `=`:

= Level 1 header (h1)
== two
=== three
==== four

#assigning-ids If the first word of a header, list item, or paragraph
is #foo, this will assign an `id=` for the element.

There is various inline formatting: *italic*, **bold**, you can do
hard linebreaks\\
and markup `code` (also like ``this``, if you want to include backquotes),
of course you can [create links http://github.com/chneukirchen/challis]
or link to plain URLs like this: [http://github.com/chneukirchen/challis].

HTML special chars are escaped with the exception of entities
(e.g. &copy;) which are left as-is.

Any character can be escaped by writing a \\ before it: `void\*`.

Insert images with double braces:

[[alt text here... http://example.org/img.jpg]]

{{example
This defines a `<div class="example">`.

It can span several paragraphs or more complex things.
}}

Sometimes it is useful {foo to markup spans of text} (= `<span class="foo">`).

== Cheatsheet

---
*italic*  **bold**  `code`  linebreak\\  {span ...}
[url]  [link text url]  [[alt text imageurl]]

* unordered     # ordered       definition:: list     " blockquote
* list          # list          another term:: defn   also quoted

= header 1      {{class names   = #id header
== header 2     }}              * #id you can link to this item
---


== Miscellaneous

The implementation is Regexp-driven, but the markup was designed for that.

This is the hardest thing I ever wrote.
